certs-Generator.bat to generate certificates for windows
certs_generator.sh to generate certificates for linux and will be used for docker too to automate this

Also, to run Redis run this command (you need docker installed, maybe will find another way in the future):
```
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```
